# Simple Shell

Project for ALX system engineering course.

## About
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Your Shell should:

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* ou have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
