.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command, inspects arguments, execute them and handles possible errors. The simple shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words at whitespaces.
