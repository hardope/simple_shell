.TH HSH 1 "28 August 2019" "Holberton" "Holberton Shell Man Page"
.SH NAME
.B hsh
\- a simple command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ FILENAME ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh executes commands read from standard input or from a file. Lines are read
one at a time. Each line is first split into tokens and dequoted. The first
word is then checked for aliases. If an alias is found, it is expanded. The
first word of the resulting command is checked to see if it is a builtin. If
it is, then hsh executes the builtin before reading the next line of input.
If it is not a builtin, a path search is performed. If the command is not
found, the status is set to 127. If the command is found but not executable,
the status is set to 126. Otherwise, hsh forks and executes the given command
before reading the next line of input.
mimic the behavior of other POSIX-compliant shells (e.g. dash)
